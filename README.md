# blenderFKIKswitch
An FK/IK switch using the Blender Python API. This is still under development to the point that the rig is in a sandbox environment, with the 3 separate rigs (FK, deform, IK from left to right when opening for the first time) separated from each other to allow for easy development. The production version will have all three rigs in the same global location, and the switch will cause only the active rig to be visible. Presently, the switch does work, copying the FK pose nearly exactly (within about 0.01 of a degree on the angle of the knee) to the IK rig when switching to IK, without the rig snapping to any other position, such as a previous pose as is common without a script to handle the transition. Works in Blender 2.93.
